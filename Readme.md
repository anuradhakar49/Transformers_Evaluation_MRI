## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset consists of grayscale MRI scans categorized into multiple brain tumor types. The datasets are uploaded under two categories
- MRI Classification: For training the model.
- MRI Segmentation: For tuning hyperparameters and validation.
- Each dataset is split into train, test and validation sets.

The scripts to access the datasets are provided here.

## ðŸ§  Models

This repository includes trained models:
- **EfficientNetB0**: Lightweight CNN model using transfer learning.
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Attention-based model adapted for image patch inputs.
- **Segformer**: Attention-based model adapted for image segmentation.
- **Maskformer**: Attention-based model adapted for image segmentation.

## ðŸš€ How to use the resources

1. Create a new python environment:
   ```
   conda create -n "myenv" python=3.11.13 ipython
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch notebooks to preprocess data or train/evaluate models.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

Evaluation metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- IoU
  
Code snippets for implementing these metrics are in the notebooks folder
